# dxf2scr_py
Python program that generates an Eagle-readable script file from a 2D DXF file.

This is starting off as a simple script. It may grow into a more user friendly GUI as time goes on. The purpose of this project is twofold. To build a usable tool and also get some experience using git. As always, time spent coding python is always welcome.
